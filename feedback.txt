Hello elisaveta this is your hackaton feedback. 

In general the app is really nice. need some userfriendly frontend:
When register the form does not tell what is each of the fields so you need to figure it out bt yourself.
In the beggining i was not able to enter to the chat it is not clear that the server needs to be running in a different terminal for it to work
Also the database to hold the information is working locally so i needed to use a local database to.

But congratulation for a really nice project. very complete and usefull. The code is well compartimented in sections.
Keep the good work.
